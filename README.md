    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

    ```
    The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following packages:
    ```
    flask

    ```

## Usage

1.  **Set API Key:**
    *   Open the `main.py` file.
    *   Replace `""` with your actual Gemini Pro API key.  You can obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console.

2.  **Run the Flask App:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will start the Flask development server.  You'll typically see output like:
    ```
     * Serving Flask app "main" (lazy loading)
     * Environment: development
     * Debug mode: on
     * Running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

3.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open your web browser and go to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).  This should display the index page of the application.

4.  **Generate a Quiz:**
    *   On the index page, you should find a file upload form.
    *   Select a PDF file that you want to use to generate the quiz.
    *   Click the "Submit" or "Generate Quiz" button.
